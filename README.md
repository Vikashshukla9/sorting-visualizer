𝐒𝐨𝐫𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐕𝐢𝐬𝐮𝐚𝐥𝐢𝐳𝐞𝐫:

An interactive Sorting Algorithm Visualizer built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
This project helps in understanding how different sorting algorithms work with real-time animations, speed control, and performance comparison.

🚀 𝐅𝐞𝐚𝐭𝐮𝐫𝐞𝐬:

🎨 𝗩𝗶𝘀𝘂𝗮𝗹𝗶𝘇𝗲 𝗠𝘂𝗹𝘁𝗶𝗽𝗹𝗲 𝗔𝗹𝗴𝗼𝗿𝗶𝘁𝗵𝗺𝘀: Bubble, Selection, Insertion, Merge, Quick, and Heap Sort

⏱ 𝗔𝗱𝗷𝘂𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗯𝗹𝗲 𝗦𝗽𝗲𝗲𝗱: Control animation speed dynamically

🔢 𝗔𝗿𝗿𝗮𝘆 𝗦𝗶𝘇𝗲 𝗖𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗿𝗼𝗹: Increase or decrease the number of elements

🔀 𝗦𝗵𝘂𝗳𝗳𝗹𝗲 & 𝗥𝗲𝘀𝗲𝘁: Randomize array or reset anytime

⏸ 𝗣𝗮𝘂𝘀𝗲/𝗥𝗲𝘀𝘂𝗺𝗲: Control sorting flow

⚖️ 𝗖𝗼𝗺𝗽𝗮𝗿𝗶𝘀𝗼𝗻 𝗠𝗼𝗱𝗲: Run two algorithms side-by-side with performance metrics

📊 𝗥𝗲𝘀𝘂𝗹𝘁 𝗣𝗼𝗽𝘂𝗽: See comparisons, swaps, and execution time after completion
